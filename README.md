# Interactive C++ Lexer Analyzer

This project implements a **Lexer Analyzer** with **advanced features and Streamlit UI**. It analyzes C/C++ code by breaking it into tokens, visualizes statistics, compares code snippets, and generates parse trees.

## Highlights

* 💻 Live coding interface via Streamlit  
* 🧪 Tokenization and error detection  
* 📊 Token frequency charts and stats  
* 🌳 Parse Tree visualization (custom)  
* 🔁 File upload & output download support  
* 🔍 Code comparison: similarity detection

## Built With

* Python  
* Streamlit  
* Regex, NLTK (for token parsing)

## Key Learning

Creating a dynamic Parse Tree from scratch using recursive logic and custom grammar was the most time-consuming and rewarding aspect.

## Team Work

Achieved a perfect score of **100/100** – rated as the **best in class** (50+ students). Shared equal workload across analysis engine, UI, and testing.
